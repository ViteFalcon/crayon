# Introduction
This project is a client for rAthena to render game-experience to the end user.

While rAthena is focused on creating a private server for Ragnarok Online, most
of the private servers create game that start from Ragnarok Online that is heavily
influenced by Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) to play the game.

The aim of this project is to provide a framework (w/ example) of how to create
a client for "Ragnarok Online"-like clients that is based on rAthena protocol.

# Why?
I grew up playing and being influenced by Ragnarok Online game. I made good
friends because of that game. I was also inspired to become a game developer
because of this game. However, I did not want to infringe any copyright or
IP in the process. This client is meant to make it possible to create custom
client based on rAthena private server without relying on Ragnarok Online
client assets to avoid copyright or IP issues.
